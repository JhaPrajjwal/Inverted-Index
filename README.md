# Inverted-Index
C++ implementation for Inverted Index (without database)

Inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a database file, or in a document or a set of documents. The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database. It is the most popular data structure used in document retrieval systems.<br/>
